            Hello, my name is Sohibjon and I am excited about the opportunity
            to work as a frontend developer intern. Although I am relatively
            new to the field, I have a strong passion for creating visually
            appealing and user-friendly websites. I have completed several
            online courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I am proficient in
            using popular front-end frameworks such as React.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 fs-3">
            During my studies, I have completed several projects that involved
            building responsive layouts, integrating with third-party APIs, and
            creating dynamic user interfaces. These projects have helped me
            hone my skills in front-end development and given me a taste of
            what it is like to work in a team environment.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 fs-4">
            I am excited about the prospect of learning more about front-end
            development through this internship and I am eager to contribute my
            skills and ideas to the team. Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting
            with new technologies and exploring the outdoors.
          </p>
          <p className='fs-4'>
            Thank you for considering me for the frontend developer internship.
            I am excited to learn and grow alongside your team!
